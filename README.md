# CSE438_MobileApps-Lab3


creative ideas:
- erase partial (where mouse is) 
- undo btn 
- Save image


creative completed: 
- outline vs solid shape option
- custom color: 
    - When the user opens the color well and changes the color, it will change the current selected color btn to be the selected color. 

EC Completed: 
- Implement two subclasses of Shape, SolidShape and OutlineShape, each with a
unique draw method. Using these classes, allow for drawing of three different shapes, either solid or outlined.
    - Toggling the swicth next to the shape will change the state. On: Filled. Off: Outline


UI Updates: 
- change shape to actual shape 
- mouse changes depending on mode
- give color and shape only in draw mode
